Android Studio Application 
Project 6 Description (README)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For project 6, I continued building my project 5 game by utilizing more of Android Studio's features. The objective to the game is clear and simple. You have to dodge the cones in your path without losing your lives. You are given three lives and if you get hit three times, you will be transitioned to the game over screen where you will be able to find your score. An instruction screen is given which you can access in the main menu. Once hit play, you will be taken to a screen where you are given the option to choose one vehicle that can be used in the game. I added a pause and quit button to the game and in addition a high score page where you can check your highscore. The text will be displayed as blue to let you know that you have achieved a new high score. I also polished the title screen by adding custom button and game title images. I added more vehicle selections + scrollview to the car selection screen. There is also a splash (welcome screen) to the application to let you know that you are being moved to the home screen.
